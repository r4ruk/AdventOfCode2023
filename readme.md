## Advent Of Code 2023

As my annual challenge and to do something else than at work I'm gonna challenge myself doing the \
puzzles in another programming language.
I don't claim any expertise or knowledge or whatsoever \
just a nice little learning challenge.

This year's challenge will be in `Rust` (where i actually have 1 week of studying experience (evenings after work),\
so basics only).

Happy coding everyone! ðŸ™‚
